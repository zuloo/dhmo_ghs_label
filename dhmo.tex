% Next are the hazard and precautionary statements and additional
% information. You should be able to find them on the MSDS for the
% substance.
\newcommand{\Hazards}{%
May be an irritant to eyes 
/ Has been known to cause temporary wrinkling of skin. 
/ Inhalation of liquid can cause serious discomfort, possible tissue damage and is often fatal. 
/ Contact with vapors above the boiling point will cause extreme pain 
/ Not known to cause permanent effects other than excessive micturation due to large amounts being ingested.
/ May cause corrosion of ferrous alloys. 
}
\newcommand{\Precautions}{%
Avoid deposition (as liquid) on floors and carpets, or sidewalks (in solid phase)
/ Avoid contact with all drying agents such as Sulfuric acid, most concentrated (dry) active chemicals such as
caustic soda and active metals such as Sodium or Potassium. /
/ Avoid contact with all electrical equipment. 
/ This material expands on freezing and should never be stored on rigid containers near, 
at or below the freezing temperature of 273.16 Kelvins. 
}
\newcommand{\Additionals}{%
In case of eye contact if irritation occurs, flush with normal saline solution.
Seek medical attention if condition persists. 
/ If swallowed, do not induce vomiting. The patient is the best judge of what help is needed. 
/ In case of excessive respiratory exposure to liquid, remove to fresh air, apply artificial respiration
and/or CPR if patient is not breathing spontaneously and/or has no detectible pulse. 
%/  In case of contact, remove excess with soft absorbent material. Contaminated clothing should be
removed and dried before reuse. Keep exposed persons warm if chilled.

% The name, address and phone number of the supplier should go here.
